LB Assessment Part 2
=======================

This project was created as a basic demonstration using AngularJS and the Github Issues API to display issues from multiple repos owned by Angular.

Keep in mind that with larger AngularJS projects this file structure and simplicity is not sufficient and should normally be structured with individual Client, Server directories, and other sub directories.

For the purpose of this demonstration the structure of this project was kept as simplistic as possible for easiest understanding.

Run the following commands to get the project up and running locally:
----------------
    $ git clone
    $ cd LBAssessmentPart2
    $ npm install && bower install
    $ lite-server
